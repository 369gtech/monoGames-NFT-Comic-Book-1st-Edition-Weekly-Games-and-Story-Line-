<h1>monoGames NFT Comic Book (1st Edition, Weekly Games and Story Line)</h1>
<p>
There are two monoGames NFT Comic Books, the first being the main monoGames NFT Comic Book and the second is a Player NFT Comic Book. The monoGames NFT Comic Book is recording events that happen in the whole of monoGames while the Player NFT Comic Book is recording certain events in a players progress in monoGames. These events are turned into a nft's for a player to stake or the game to automate staking for the player.</p>
  
There are 3 main sections to the Comic Book;
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>First Edition</li>
  <li>Weekly Game Play</li>
  <li>monoGames Metaverse "Destiny Of The Universe"</li>
</ol>
<p>
First Edition is when you complete your first new reward task nft in selected parts of the game which is automatically staked in your Player NFT Comic Book to earn you rewards. If your the first to do a new reward task in all of monoGames, your nft is automatically staked in the main monoGames NFT Comic Book to earn extra rewards.

Weekly Game Play is connected to the monoGames Metaverse "Destiny Of The Universe" so when you complete special missions and certain game play, you are rewarded with nft's that can be staked in your Player Comic Book. If your lucky as a player the monoGames might choose your game play of the week to post in the main monoGames NFT Comic Book to earn extra rewards.

The Story Line is where the game randomly choose an event that you were apart of in monoGames and creates an nft to be staked in your player NFT Comic Book so player remember their journey and it also earns staking rewards too. If your lucky as a player the monoGames might choose your game play of the week to post in the monoGames NFT Comic Book to earn extra rewards.

monoGames will select the First Edition NFT of any one in the game who completes that first reward, select a combination of winning and game play in the Weekly Game Play from "Destiny Of The Universe" and also select random game play from players time lines to go into the monoGames NFT Comic Book where players can earn extra rewards. 
  
monoGames will create and sell copies of its Comic Book weekly that can be staked in a special part of the Comic Book. These Comic Books when staked will earn rewards for players. You can upgrade the Comic book by merging them and creating rare, epic and legendary Comic Books depending on how many you merge.

Your personal Comic can be leveled up which will earn you more rewards as you level from common, rare, epic, legendary to monoTomic Gold. To do this your nft's that are staked will have reward power, so if you are staking mainly common nft's you will receive common reward power granting you common level rewards. So the idea is for players to stake higher tiers nft's to increase a players staking earning capacity.
